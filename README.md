## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have become more competant with flexbox and grid and am finding it easier to manipulate these to render the end result.

### Continued development

I still need to learn more about flexbox and grid, specifically alignment.

### Useful resources

I found the following two guides that were great:

Flexbox guide: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

Grid Guide: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
